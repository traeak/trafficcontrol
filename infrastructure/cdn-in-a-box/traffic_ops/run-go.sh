# Script for running the Dockerfile for Traffic Ops.
# The Dockerfile sets up a Docker image which can be used for any new Traffic Ops container;
# This script, which should be run when the container is run (it's the ENTRYPOINT), will configure the container.
#
# The following environment variables must be set, ordinarily by `docker run -e` arguments:
# DB_SERVER
# DB_PORT
# DB_ROOT_PASS
# DB_USER
# DB_USER_PASS
# DB_NAME
# ADMIN_USER
# ADMIN_PASS
# CERT_COUNTRY
# CERT_STATE
# CERT_CITY
# CERT_COMPANY
# DOMAIN

# TODO:  Unused -- should be removed?  TRAFFIC_VAULT_PASS

# Check that env vars are set

set -x
envvars=( DB_SERVER DB_PORT DB_ROOT_PASS DB_USER DB_USER_PASS ADMIN_USER ADMIN_PASS CERT_COUNTRY CERT_STATE CERT_CITY CERT_COMPANY DOMAIN)

# Write config files
